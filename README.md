# Abuse-detection-ml
A deep learning approach to detecting and moderating abusive content in sports-related discussions using BERT.

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to identify abusive content in sports commentary while maintaining awareness of context-specific language. The model achieves approximately 90% accuracy across testing scenarios.

## Key Features
- BERT-based classification model
- Synthetic data generation for training
- Context-aware abuse detection
- Production-ready deployment code

## Results
Our model achieved:
- Training accuracy: 90.73%
- Validation accuracy: 89.93%
- Test accuracy: 89.60%
