# Abuse Detection Model Documentation

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution for detecting abusive content in sports-related social media discussions. Using BERT-based classification and carefully crafted synthetic data, our model achieves approximately 90% accuracy while maintaining awareness of sports-specific context and language patterns.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Generation
Our data generation system creates realistic sports commentary by incorporating several key elements:

1. Basic Content Generation
   - Uses templates for both positive and negative content
   - Includes real team and player names for authenticity
   - Balances abusive and non-abusive content

2. Complexity Layers
   - Introduces realistic typos (30% probability)
   - Adds sarcastic elements (20% probability)
   - Maintains natural language patterns

### Model Architecture
We utilize a BERT-based classification model with the following specifications:
- Base Model: bert-base-uncased
- Maximum Sequence Length: 128 tokens
- Batch Size: 32
- Learning Rate: 2e-5

### Performance Metrics
Our model achieved consistent performance across different datasets:
- Training Accuracy: 90.73%
- Validation Accuracy: 89.93%
- Test Accuracy: 89.60%

These metrics demonstrate robust performance while avoiding overfitting, as evidenced by the consistent scores across all datasets.

## Usage Guide

### Setting Up the Environment
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages
3. Generate synthetic data using data_generation.py
4. Train the model using model_training.py

### Model Training Process
The training process includes:
- Data preprocessing and tokenization
- Three-epoch training cycle
- Regular validation checks
- Performance monitoring

### Interpreting Results
Our model provides confidence scores for both abusive and non-abusive classifications. For example:
- Clear positive content ("Great game today!") → 99.99% non-abusive
- Direct abuse → ~79.52% abusive
- Ambiguous content → More nuanced confidence scores

## Future Improvements
Areas identified for future development:
1. Enhanced context understanding
2. Multi-language support
3. Real-time adaptation capabilities
4. Improved handling of sarcasm and subtle abuse
